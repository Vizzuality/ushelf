# FriendlyId

FriendlyId is the "Swiss Army bulldozer" of slugging and permalink plugins for
Ruby on Rails. It allows you to create pretty URL's and work with
human-friendly strings as if they were numeric ids for Active Record models.

Using FriendlyId, it's easy to make your application use URL's like:

    http://example.com/states/washington

instead of:

    http://example.com/states/4323454

## FriendlyId Features

FriendlyId offers many advanced features, including: slug history and
versioning, scoped slugs, reserved words, custom slug generators, and
excellent Unicode support. For complete information on using FriendlyId,
please see the [FriendlyId Guide](http://norman.github.com/friendly_id/file.Guide.html).

FriendlyId is compatible with Active Record **2.3.x** and **3.0**.

## Rails Quickstart

Note that the example below uses Rails 3. But don't worry: FriendlyId will
continue to support 2.3.x until Rails 3.1 is released.

    gem install friendly_id

    rails new my_app

    cd my_app

    # add to Gemfile
    gem "friendly_id", "~> 3.1"

    rails generate friendly_id
    rails generate scaffold user name:string cached_slug:string

    rake db:migrate

    # edit app/models/user.rb
    class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_friendly_id :name, :use_slug => true
    end

    User.create! :name => "Joe Schmoe"

    rails server

    GET http://0.0.0.0:3000/users/joe-schmoe

## Sequel and DataMapper, too

[Alex Coles](http://github.com/myabc) maintains an implemntation of
[FriendlyId for DataMapper](http://github.com/myabc/friendly_id_datamapper) that supports almost
all the features of the Active Record version.

Norman Clarke maintains an implementation of
[FriendlyId forSequel](http://github.com/norman/friendly_id_sequel) with some of the features
of the Active Record version.
